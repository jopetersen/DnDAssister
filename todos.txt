To-Dos:

- Create a simple graphical user interface that has a button that's used to "generate a character with random stats"
    - Determine optimal stat configuration for each class
        -- Make a dropdown in the GUI to select a character class, store that value & auto assign optimal values
            -- OR display the sum_dices & allow the user to allocate their stats as they wish 
        -- Would need to add a character name, check to see how forbidden characters (e.g. spaces) work or are handled
- Create a database for potential characters
- Figure out how to remove values from an array for the strength updater
    - Maybe abstract the function so that I don't have to keep copy/pasting it to update? 
        Not sure how this would work with multiple stats though.
