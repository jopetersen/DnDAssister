Things to learn -- The purpose of this doc is to list things that 
I'm going to need to learn about before I'm able to build/design this program like I want to

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- How to connect a database/which databases to use for the characters/NPCs?
- Error/exception handling: 
    - Try: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html 

Questions:
- Should I use multiple .py docs/split up the class builder functions from the core? 
    What is the best practice?
